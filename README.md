### Morning Mindfulness and Spiritual Start  
Our HOD, Harpreet Kaur Grewal Ma'am, offered a quiet relaxation session to start the day. We were instructed to focus our inner energy and attain peace while keeping our eyes closed.  
We started the day by remembering the divine by reciting the Mool Mantra. It was a brief but impactful period of quiet and peacefulness that calmed our minds.

### 9:15 AM – Expert Lecture by Dr. Jaswinder Singh (Incharge – IAPT)  
Dr. Jaswinder Singh delivered a meaningful and inspiring session that combined science, spirituality, and personal growth. He explained that mathematics is more than numbers—it is the universal language we use to understand and connect with the world. He reminded us how we interact with numbers from the very first moment we wake up when we look at the clock.
He encouraged us to take college as an opportunity to truly grow, saying:  
> “Don’t just study in college, learn.”

He also shared the spiritual significance of the number 108:  
- 1 represents God  
- 0 represents humans  
- 8 represents worldly distractions  
It is up to us whether we walk toward God or toward the world. And if we are caught between both, 1 + 8 equals 9 — which represents *Naam*, the name of God. By reciting the Naam, we can stay centered and succeed in life.
He spoke about the importance of meditation, spiritual discipline, and making time for the divine in our daily routine. One powerful takeaway was:  
> “Ghat karo, par changi tarah karo.”  
(Do less, but do it with sincerity and depth.)

### 11:30 AM – Expert Lecture by Dr. Priyadarshni Ma’am on Universal Human Values  
This session focused on understanding the real purpose of life. Dr. Priyadarshni Ma’am encouraged open discussion and guided us to reflect on what we truly want—whether it’s money, comfort, or genuine happiness.

She shared that most people aim for high-paying jobs and material success, thinking that will bring happiness. But true happiness doesn’t come from temporary excitement. It comes from contentment—being at peace with what we already have.

She emphasized the importance of:  
- Right understanding before material gain  
- Awareness of our true needs  
- Building strong, meaningful relationships  
- Then fulfilling physical needs with clarity

### Closing Words by HOD Harpreet Kaur Grewal Ma’am  
The day ended with encouraging words from our HOD. She answered student questions, shared thoughtful advice, and reminded us to stay consistent with our practice—especially in mathematics. Her guidance was warm, honest, and supportive.
